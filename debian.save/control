Description: Never forget to initialize your C++ variables!
 The controlled_vars.h and other header files are C++ templates, that gives you
 the ability to control the initialization of your basic C types (i.e. char,
 int, long long, etc.)
 Especially, it allows you to avoid forgetting the initialization of variable
 members since these variables cannot be initialized where declared1. Classes
 are here to help you and they do a great job at this, even for basic types
 such as char, int, and long variables. Really! My main C++ bugs came from
 forgetting the initialization of variable members and this is the reason why I
 created these headers.
 Controlled Variables can actually be used anywhere you declare a basic type
 variable without immediately initializing it (and limited controlled variables
 anywhere a bounded value is used.)
