This package includes the source file used to generate the
controlled_vars.h header file. That's the sole purpose of this
file. However, the controlled_vars.h is 22Kb so it's quite
useful to have a generator!

To recompile your own version, you can use CMake as in:

  tar xf controlled_vars-1.1.0.tar.gz
  mkdir BUILD
  cd BUILD
  cmake ../controlled_vars-1.1.0
  make

(change the version as necessary)

After the make ran, you should have the controlled_vars.h and
the test controlled_vars_test that you can run to see whether
it works for you. Edit the test to change it and test your own
code...

Documentation on how to use controlled variables in your C++
code is available on the http://snapwebsites.org/ website.
